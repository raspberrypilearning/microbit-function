Repeating a large group of blocks makes our code untidy.

If you need to re-use code, it is sometimes better to put it in a function and then 'call' the function to run.

A <span style="color: #0faeb0">function</span> is a group of blocks that you can create and name. You can run those blocks by 'calling' the name of the function. Another word for a function is a <span style="color: #0faeb0">subprogram</span>, because it can be called to run from the main program.

## To create a function

You can find function blocks in the Advanced menu in your Toolbox.

Click the Functions menu and then click `Make a Function`.

Name the function.

The code in your function will not run until you 'call' it.

## To call a function

From the Advanced > Functions menu, drag out the `call` block for your function.
