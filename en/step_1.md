Repeating a large group of blocks makes our code untidy.

If you need to re-use code, it is sometimes better to put it in a function and then 'call' the function to run. 

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">

A <span style="color: #0faeb0">function</span> is a group of blocks that you can create and name. You can run those blocks by 'calling' the name of the function. Another word for a function is a <span style="color: #0faeb0">subprogram</span>, because it can be called to run from the main program.
